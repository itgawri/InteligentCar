# InteligentCar
The "Intelligent Car" project presents the implementation of a car class in Python, allowing interactive management and control of a car with intelligent functionalities. The Car class is the central element of the project, enabling control of fuel consumption, possible destinations, and tracking the traveled route.

Here are the main functions and methods of the Car class:

Car Initialization: Creating a car instance with a specified fuel consumption per unit of distance and available destinations.

Driving: The ride() method allows starting a journey and monitors fuel availability. If there is enough fuel, it adds the traveled distance and reduces the available fuel.

Distance Checking: The check_distance() method checks if the car has enough fuel for the journey.

Calculating Average Speed: The calculate_average_speed() function calculates the average speed based on the traveled distance and travel time.

Traveling to a Destination: The ride_to_destination() method allows traveling to a specified destination if it is available among the possible destinations.

Fuel Charging: The recharge() method allows charging fuel into the car, increasing the available travel distance.

This project demonstrates interactive car management and control over its route and fuel. You can customize car parameters and use it to simulate various travel scenarios. This project can also serve as a starting point for more advanced applications related to intelligent vehicles.
